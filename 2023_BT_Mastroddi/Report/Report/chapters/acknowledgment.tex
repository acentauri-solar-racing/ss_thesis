I would like to thank the \enquote{Alpha Centauri} team for the amazing opportunity of collaborating in such a pleasant and well organized environment.

A special thanks goes to my supervisor Fabio Widmer for his availability, clarity and passion in the explanations, and his overall support, especially in proposing the underlying idea presented in~\cref{chp:strategy} and proof reading the report multiple times.

I would also thank Michael von BÃ¼ren for the unfortunately sporadic but incredibly interesting discussions, Andreas Ritter for the clear suggestions and explanations about Matlab and LaTex, my brother for proof reading the report, Theo Auckenthaler for providing incredibly useful material about photovoltaic system modeling, the \enquote{OpenAI} team for their incredibly useful website~\cite{chatgpt:2022webpage} that I used to correct the english of the report, and last but not least my family and girlfriend for the support and motivation.

It was a pleasure to write the thesis and work as teaching assistant in this lab. I really enjoyed this learning experience.
