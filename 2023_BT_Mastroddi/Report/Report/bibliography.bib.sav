  abstract       = {Solar cars are known for their energy efficiency, and different races are designed to measure their performance under certain conditions. For these races, in addition to an efficient vehicle, a competition strategy is required to define the optimal speed, with the objective of finishing the race in the shortest possible time using the energy available. Two heuristic optimization methods are implemented to solve this problem, a convergence and performance comparison of both methods is presented. A computational model of the race is developed, including energy input, consumption and storage systems. Based on this model, the different optimization methods are tested on the optimization of the World Solar Challenge 2015 race strategy under two different environmental conditions. A suitable method for solar car racing strategy is developed with the vehicle specifications taken as an independent input to permit the simulation of different solar or electric vehicles.},

  abstract = {An essential stage in assessing the feasibility of a PV project is the energy yield prediction, which estimates the total energy production of a PV system at a specific site. Photovoltaic (PV) performance models are mathematical representations used to estimate the energy yield of power systems based on PV technology. The PV performance models are subjected to a series of errors derived from the different steps in the modeling chain of the PV system. Although some studies have been conducted to assess the accuracy of these models, limited research have focused on studying the accuracy of the individual submodels that comprise the PV performance model. The main objective of this paper is to assess the performance of different combinations of the most cited models aiming to find a PV performance model with good accuracy. There were studied a total of 20 PV performance models derived from the combination of four plane-of-the-array (POA) irradiance models, five PV module models and two inverter models. All the PV performance models were implemented computationally and their performance was compared with measurements collected by a data acquisition system in a real 2.2kWp photovoltaic system. The best PV performance model presents an accuracy of −0.201% (rMBE) and 15.099% (rRMSE) with respect to the measured AC power output, which is in line with the values reported in the literature. Several sources of error were identified, which can greatly influence PV system energy yield estimation. Among them, the uncertainty in the derating factors which represent all the non-temperature dependent losses present in the PV system is the most critical.},
